  abstract = {Scanning confocal microscopy offers several potential advantages for
	light microscope studies of biological material. Foremost amongst
	these is the rejection of interfering signals from out-of-focus structures,
	which often seriously degrade images. The degradation in image quality
	with epifluorescence microscopy is particularly pronounced; an unfortunate
	situation, as this is one of the most commonly used techniques in
	biological research. Confocal imaging almost completely eliminates
	this problem and therefore promises to have a wide application in
	this area. We have developed a high-speed beam scanning confocal
	imaging system that can be used in conjunction with a conventional
	microscope, and have examined a variety of biological material using
	this system. In all cases we have found that confocal imaging gives
	a marked improvement in quality over conventional techniques. viewed

	two-photon excitation patterns generated large photocurrents in Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing
	cultured cells and neurons and in mouse acute cortical slices. The

  abstract = {The dynamic ability of neuronal dendrites to shape and integrate synaptic
	responses is the hallmark of information processing in the brain.
	Effectively studying this phenomenon requires concurrent measurements
	at multiple sites on live neurons. Significant progress has been
	made by optical imaging systems which combine confocal and multiphoton
	microscopy with inertia-free laser scanning. However, all systems
	developed to date restrict fast imaging to two dimensions. This severely
	limits the extent to which neurons can be studied, since they represent
	complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. Here we present a novel
	imaging system that utilizes a unique arrangement of acousto-optic
	deflectors to steer a focused ultra-fast laser beam to arbitrary
	locations in 3D space without moving the objective lens. As we demonstrate,
	this highly versatile random-access multiphoton microscope supports
	functional imaging of complex 3D cellular structures such as neuronal
	dendrites or neural populations at acquisition rates on the order
	of tens of kilohertz.},
