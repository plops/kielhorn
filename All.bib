abstract = {One of the ongoing challenges in single particle fluores- cence microscopy resides in estimating the axial position of particles with sub-resolution precision. Due to the complexity of the diffraction patterns generated by such particles, the standard fitting methods used to estimate a particle’s lateral position are not applicable. A new approach for axial localization is proposed: it consists of a maximum-likelihood estimator based on a theoretical image formation model that incorporates noise. The fundamental theoretical limits on localization are studied, using Cram´ er-Rao bounds. These indicate that the proposed approach can be used to localize particles with nanometer-scale precision. Using phantom data generated according to the image formation model, it is then shown that the precision of the proposed estimator reaches the fundamental limits. Moreover, the approach is tested on experimental data, and sub-resolution localization at the 10 nm scale is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Fluorophores that are fixed during image acquisition produce a diffraction pattern that is characteristic of the orientation of the fluorophore's underlying dipole. Fluorescence localization microscopy techniques such as PALM and STORM achieve super-resolution by applying Gaussian-based fitting algorithms to in-focus images of individual fluorophores; when applied to fixed dipoles, this can lead to a bias in the range of 5-20 nm.We introduce a method for the joint estimation of position and orientation of dipoles, based on the representation of a physically realistic image formation model as a 3-D steerable filter. Our approach relies on a single, defocused acquisition. We establish theoretical, localization-based resolution limits on estimation accuracy using Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds, and experimentally show that estimation accuracies of at least 5 nm for position and of at least 2 degrees for orientation can be achieved. Patterns generated by applying the image formation model to estimated position/orientation pairs closely match experimental observations.},

@article{Amos2003a,
abstract = {In this paper, differential phase imaging (DPC) with transmitted light is implemented by adding a suitable detection system to a standard commercially available scanning confocal microscope. DPC, a long-established method in scanning optical microscopy, depends on detecting the intensity difference between opposite halves or quadrants of a split photodiode detector placed in an aperture plane. Here, DPC is compared with scanned differential interference contrast (DIC) using a variety of biological specimens and objective lenses of high numerical aperture. While DPC and DIC images are generally similar, DPC seems to have a greater depth of field. DPC has several advantages over DIC. These include low cost (no polarizing or strain-free optics are required), absence of a double scanning spot, electronically variable direction of shading and the ability to image specimens in plastic dishes where birefringence prevents the use of DIC. DPC is also here found to need 20 times less laser power at the specimen than DIC.},

@article{Amos1987,
abstract = {Scanning confocal microscopy offers several potential advantages for
light microscope studies of biological material. Foremost amongst
these is the rejection of interfering signals from out-of-focus structures,
which often seriously degrade images. The degradation in image quality
with epifluorescence microscopy is particularly pronounced; an unfortunate
situation, as this is one of the most commonly used techniques in
biological research. Confocal imaging almost completely eliminates
this problem and therefore promises to have a wide application in
this area. We have developed a high-speed beam scanning confocal
imaging system that can be used in conjunction with a conventional
microscope, and have examined a variety of biological material using
this system. In all cases we have found that confocal imaging gives
a marked improvement in quality over conventional techniques. viewed
with epifluorescence.},

@article{Bachmann2006,
abstract = {One of the main drawbacks of Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT) is the limited measurement depth range. Phase shifting techniques allow reconstructing the complex sample signal resulting in a doubled depth range. In current complex FDOCT realizations the phase shift is introduced via a reference path length modulation, which causes chromatic phase errors especially if broad bandwidth light sources are employed. With acousto-optic frequency shifters in the reference and sample arm, and the detector being locked to the resulting beating frequency, the signal is quadrature detected at high speed. The beating signal frequency is the same for all wavelengths allowing for achromatic complex reconstruction. With a Ti:Sapphire laser at 800nm and spectral width of 130nm, a heterodyne complex FDOCT system is realized with 20kHz line rate and an axial resolution of 4mum.},

@article{Berezhna2005,
abstract = {We report on new insights into the mechanisms of short single and double stranded oligonucleotide release from cationic lipid complexes (lipoplexes), used in gene therapy. Specifically, we modeled endosomal membranes using giant unilamellar vesicles and investigated the roles of various individual cellular phospholipids in interaction with lipoplexes. Our approach uses a combination of confocal imaging, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and single particle tracking, revealing several new aspects of the release: (a) phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are equally active in disassembling lipoplexes, while phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin are inert; (b) in contrast to earlier findings, phosphatidylethanolamine alone, in the absence of anionic phosphatidylserine triggers extensive release; (c) a double-stranded DNA structure remains well preserved after release; (d) lipoplexes exhibited preferential binding to transient lipid domains, which appear at the onset of lipoplex attachment to originally uniform membranes and vanish after initiation of polynucleotide release. The latter effect is likely related to phosphatidyleserine redistribution in membranes due to lipoplex binding. Real time tracking of single DOTAP/DOPE and DOTAP/DOPC lipoplexes showed that both particles remained compact and associated with membranes up to 1-2 min before fusion, indicating that a more complex mechanism, different from suggested earlier rapid fusion, promotes more efficient transfection by DOTAP/DOPE complexes.},

The minimum acceptable separation between features depends on the point-spread function in the (m + n)d-dimensional space formed by the spatial coordinates and the optical parameters, whereas the absolute spatial resolution is determined by the accuracy to which the coordinates can be measured. Estimates of each suggest that near-field fluorescence excitation microscopy/spectroscopy with molecular sensitivity and spatial resolution is possible.},

abstract = {In conventional microscopes, fluorescence emission is separated from the backscattered illumination using the Stokes shift, whereby the emission occurs at a longer wavelength to the excitation. Such separation is usually achieved through a combination of wavelength filters that divide the spectrum into mutually exclusive excitation and emission bands. It is therefore impossible in these microscopes to access the full excitation/emission spectrum of the specimen in a single image. We report on a microscope that acquired fluorescence images using illumination across the spectral range 450-680 nm; the full emission spectrum was detected simultaneously across the same range. The microscope was also combined with structured illumination optical sectioning to give three-dimensionally resolved images with improved background rejection. Full spectrum fluorescence images of biological specimens are demonstrated. As this system is more versatile than the standard fluorescence microscope, it could be of benefit in many fluorescence imaging applications.},

This has required various departures from the traditional adaptive optics schemes that are used in astronomy. This review discusses the sources of aberrations, their effects and their correction with adaptive optics, particularly in confocal and two-photon microscopes. Different methods of wavefront sensing, indirect aberration measurement and aberration correction devices are discussed. Applications of adaptive optics in the related areas of optical data storage, optical tweezers and micro/nanofabrication are also reviewed.},

abstract = {The standard microscope architecture around which confocal microscopes are built imposes fundamental restrictions on the speed with which images (three-dimensional data sets) can be obtained. Commercially available slit scanning confocal microscopes are able to produce optically sectioned images at frame rates well in excess of 100 Hz. However only the focal (x-y) plane can be imaged at this speed. To image a volume specimen it is necessary to physically change the distance between the objective lens and the specimen. This refocusing process is often necessarily slow and represents a bottleneck to the speed of image acquisition. We describe the construction of a slit scanning confocal microscope based on what we know to be a novel microscope architecture, which permits images of other planes and, particular, the meridional (x-z) plane to be acquired in real time.},

abstract = {We present a nonparametric regression method for denoising 3-D image sequences acquired via fluorescence microscopy. The proposed method exploits the redundancy of the 3-D+time information to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of images corrupted by Poisson-Gaussian noise. A variance stabilization transform is first applied to the image-data to remove the dependence between the mean and variance of intensity values. This preprocessing requires the knowledge of parameters related to the acquisition system, also estimated in our approach. In a second step, we propose an original statistical patch-based framework for noise reduction and preservation of space-time discontinuities. In our study, discontinuities are related to small moving spots with high velocity observed in fluorescence video-microscopy. The idea is to minimize an objective nonlocal energy functional involving spatio-temporal image patches. The minimizer has a simple form and is defined as the weighted average of input data taken in spatially-varying neighborhoods. The size of each neighborhood is optimized to improve the performance of the pointwise estimator. The performance of the algorithm (which requires no motion estimation) is then evaluated on both synthetic and real image sequences using qualitative and quantitative criteria.},

We tracked the migration of oskar mRNA in real time, from the nurse cells where it is produced to the posterior cortex of the oocyte where it is localized. Our observations reveal the presence of a transient, and heretofore elusive, stage in the transport of oskar mRNA. Direct visualization of specific mRNAs in living cells with molecular beacons will accelerate studies of intracellular RNA trafficking and localization, just as the use of green fluorescent protein has stimulated the study of specific proteins in vivo.},

abstract = {A quantitative explanation of tropospheric radio propagation is derived without the use of arbitrary numerical factors. It is based primarily on the average value and the standard deviation of the index of refraction at the earth's surface, both of which decrease exponentially with height. This method seems to bridge the gap between the internal reflection and scatter hypotheses. The quantitative results are in good agreement with experimental data on distance dependence, frequency dependence, climatic and seasonal variations, and effective antenna gain. One consequence is a new concept of the decrease in effective gain of narrow-beam antennas, which accounts for some hitherto unexplained experimental results.},

@article{Caarls2011,
abstract = {The exposure of fluorophores to intense illumination in a microscope often results in photobleaching and phototoxicity, thus constituting a major limiting factor in time lapse live cell or single molecule imaging. Laser scanning confocal microscopes are particularly prone to this problem, inasmuch as they require high irradiances to compensate for the inherently low duty cycle of point scanning systems. In the attempt to maintain adequate speed and signal-to-noise ratios, the fluorophores are often driven into saturation, thereby generating a nonlinear response. One approach for reducing photodegradation in the laser scanning confocal microscope is represented by controlled light exposure microscopy, introduced by Manders and colleagues. The strategy is to reduce the illumination intensity in both background areas (devoid of information) as well as in bright foreground regions, for which an adequate signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved with lower excitation levels than those required for the less intense foreground pixels/voxels. Such a variable illumination scheme can also be exploited in widefield microscopes that employ lower irradiance but higher illumination duty cycles. We report here on the adaptation of the controlled light exposure microscopy principle to the programmable array microscope, which achieves optical sectioning by use of a spatial light modulator (SLM) in an image plane as a programmable mask for illumination and conjugate (and nonconjugate) detection. By incorporating the basic controlled light exposure microscopy concept for minimizing exposure, we have obtained a reduction in the rate of photobleaching of up to \~{}5-fold, while maintaining an image quality comparable to regular imaging with the programmable array microscope.},

abstract = {We developed a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) system that uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to generate interference illumination patterns at four orientations - 0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, and 135 degrees, to reconstruct a high-resolution image. The use of a SLM for pattern alterations is rapid and precise, without mechanical calibration; moreover, our design of SLM patterns allows generating the four illumination patterns of high contrast and nearly equivalent periods to achieve a near isotropic enhancement in lateral resolution. We compare the conventional image of 100-nm beads with those reconstructed from two (0 degrees +90 degrees or 45 degrees +135 degrees) and four (0 degrees +45 degrees +90 degrees +135 degrees) pattern orientations to show the differences in resolution and image, with the support of simulations. The reconstructed images of 200-nm beads at various depths and fine structures of actin filaments near the edge of a HeLa cell are presented to demonstrate the intensity distributions in the axial direction and the prospective application to biological systems.},

abstract = {Autoconfocal microscopy (ACM) is a simple implementation of a transmitted-light confocal microscopy where a nonlinear detector plays the role of a virtual self-aligned pinhole. We report here a significant improvement of ACM based on the use of graded-field (GF) imaging. The technique of GF imaging involves introducing partial beam blocks in the illumination and detection apertures of an imaging system. These partial beam blocks confer phase-gradient sensitivity to the imaging system and allow control over its background level. We present the theory of the GF contrast in the context of ACM, comparing it to GF contrast in a non-scanning widefield microscope, and discuss various performance characteristics of GF-ACM in terms of resolution, sectioning strength, and an "under-detection" light collection geometry. An advantage of ACM is that it can be readily combined with two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy. We present images of rat brain hippocampus using simultaneous GF-ACMand TPEF microscopy. These images are inherently co-registered.},

However, pupil filters can improve signal-to-noise performance and modify transfer-function zero crossing positions, as demonstrated through a confocal fluorescence example.},

abstract = {We implement wave front sensor-less adaptive optics in a structured illumination microscope. We investigate how the image formation process in this type of microscope is affected by aberrations. It is found that aberrations can be classified into two groups, those that affect imaging of the illumination pattern and those that have no influence on this pattern. We derive a set of aberration modes ideally suited to this application and use these modes as the basis for an efficient aberration correction scheme. Each mode is corrected independently through the sequential optimisation of an image quality metric. Aberration corrected imaging is demonstrated using fixed fluorescent specimens. Images are further improved using differential aberration imaging for reduction of background fluorescence.},

and photo-bleaching were confined to the vicinity of the focal plane
as expected for cooperative two-photon excitation. This technique
also provides unprecedented capabilities for three-dimensional, spatially
resolved photochemistry, particularly photolytic release of caged
effector molecules.},

abstract = {Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy was used to determine the kinetic properties of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins in whole living Drosophila organisms (embryos) and tissues (wing imaginal discs and salivary glands). PcG genes are essential genes in higher eukaryotes responsible for the maintenance of the spatially distinct repression of developmentally important regulators such as the homeotic genes. Their absence, as well as overexpression, causes transformations in the axial organization of the body. Although protein complexes have been isolated in vitro, little is known about their stability or exact mechanism of repression in vivo. We determined the translational diffusion constants of PcG proteins, dissociation constants and residence times for complexes in vivo at different developmental stages. In polytene nuclei, the rate constants suggest heterogeneity of the complexes. Computer simulations with new models for spatially distributed protein complexes were performed in systems showing both diffusion and binding equilibria, and the results compared with our experimental data. We were able to determine forward and reverse rate constants for complex formation. Complexes exchanged within a period of 1-10 minutes, more than an order of magnitude faster than the cell cycle time, ruling out models of repression in which access of transcription activators to the chromatin is limited and demonstrating that long-term repression primarily reflects mass-action chemical equilibria.},

abstract = {Previous implementations of structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) were slow or designed for one-color excitation, sacrificing two unique and extremely beneficial aspects of light microscopy: live-cell imaging in multiple colors. This is especially unfortunate because, among the resolution-extending techniques, SIM is an attractive choice for live-cell imaging; it requires no special fluorophores or high light intensities to achieve twice diffraction-limited resolution in three dimensions. Furthermore, its wide-field nature makes it light-efficient and decouples the acquisition speed from the size of the lateral field of view, meaning that high frame rates over large volumes are possible. Here, we report a previously undescribed SIM setup that is fast enough to record 3D two-color datasets of living whole cells. Using rapidly programmable liquid crystal devices and a flexible 2D grid pattern algorithm to switch between excitation wavelengths quickly, we show volume rates as high as 4 s in one color and 8.5 s in two colors over tens of time points. To demonstrate the capabilities of our microscope, we image a variety of biological structures, including mitochondria, clathrin-coated vesicles, and the actin cytoskeleton, in either HeLa cells or cultured neurons.},

abstract = {We present a novel microscopy technique to measure the scattered wavefront emitted from an optically transparent microscopic object. The complex amplitude is decoded via phase stepping in a common-path interferometer, enabling high mechanical stability. We demonstrate theoretically and practically that the incoherent summation of multiple illumination directions into a single image increases the resolving power and facilitates image reconstruction in diffraction tomography. We propose a slice-by-slice object-scatter extraction algorithm entirely based in real space in combination with ordinary z-stepping. Thereby the computational complexity affiliated with tomographic methods is significantly reduced. Using the first order Born approximation for weakly scattering objects it is possible to obtain estimates of the scattering density from the exitwaves.},

We present data on: (1) two-photon excitation; (2) fluorescence lifetimes; (3) ensemble and single QD emission anisotropy; (4) QDs as donors for Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET); and (5) spectral conversion of QDs exposed to high-intensity illumination. We also demonstrate the utility of QDs for (1) imaging the binding and uptake of biotinylated transferrin on living cells, and (2) resolving by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) signals originating from QDs from those of spatially and spectrally overlapping visible fluorescent proteins (VFPs).},

@article{Grossman2010,
abstract = {Studying neuronal processes such as synaptic summation, dendritic
physiology and neural network dynamics requires complex spatiotemporal
control over neuronal activities. The recent development of neural
photosensitization tools, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), offers
new opportunities for non-invasive, flexible and cell-specific neuronal
stimulation. Previously, complex spatiotemporal control of photosensitized
neurons has been limited by the lack of appropriate optical devices
which can provide 2D stimulation with sufficient irradiance. Here
we present a simple and powerful solution that is based on an array
of high-power micro light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) that can generate
arbitrary optical excitation patterns on a neuronal sample with micrometre
and millisecond resolution. We first describe the design and fabrication
of the system and characterize its capabilities. We then demonstrate
its capacity to elicit precise electrophysiological responses in
cultured and slice neurons expressing ChR2.},

abstract = {Pupil functions are compact and modifiable descriptions of the three-dimensional (3D) imaging properties of wide-field optical systems. The pupil function of a microscope can be computationally estimated from the measured point spread function (PSF) using phase retrieval algorithms. The compaction of a 3D PSF into a 2D pupil function suppresses artefacts and measurement noise without resorting to rotational averaging. We show here that such 'phase-retrieved' pupil functions can reproduce features in the optical path, both near the sample and in the microscope. Unlike the PSF, the pupil function can be easily modified to include known aberrations, such as those induced by index-mismatched mounting media, simply by multiplying the pupil function by a calculated aberration function. PSFs calculated from such a modified pupil function closely match the corresponding measured PSFs collected under the aberrated imaging conditions. When used for image deconvolution of simulated objects, these phase-retrieved, calculated PSFs perform similarly to directly measured PSFs.},

abstract = {Conventional fluorescence microscopy can be used to determine the positions of objects in space when those objects are separated by distances greater than several hundred nanometers, as restricted by the diffraction limit of light. Fluorescence microscopy/spectroscopy based on fluorescence resonance energy-transfer techniques can be used to measure separation distances below approximately 10 nm. To fill the gap between these fundamental limits, we have developed an alternative technique for high-resolution colocalization of fluorescent dyes. The technique is based on fluorescence lifetime imaging. Under favorable conditions, the method can be used to distinguish, and to measure the distance between, two dye molecules that are less than 30 nm apart. To demonstrate the method, lifetime images of a mixture of Cy5 and JF9 (rhodamine derivative) molecules statistically adsorbed on a glass surface were acquired and analyzed. Since these two molecular species differ in fluorescence lifetime (for Cy5, tau(f) = 2.0 ns, and for JF9, tau(f) = 4.0 ns), it is possible to assign the contribution of fluorescence of the two dye types to each image pixel using a pattern recognition technique. Since both dye types can be excited using the same laser wavelength, the measurement is free of chromatic aberrations. The results presented demonstrate the first high-precision distance measurements between single conventional fluorescent dyes based solely on fluorescence lifetime.},

abstract = {By physical rotation of the sample, axial tomography enables the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible spatial information from an object. In combination with confocal microscopy, the method can fundamentally improve the effective three-dimensional (3D) resolution. In this report we present a novel method for high resolution reconstruction of confocal axial tomographic data. The method automatically determines the relative angles of rotation, aligns the data from different rotational views and reconstructs a single high resolution 3D dataset. The reconstruction makes use of a known point spread function and is based on an unconstrained maximum likelihood deconvolution performed simultaneously from multiple (in our case three) angular views. It was applied to simulated as well as to experimental confocal datasets. The gain in resolution was quantified and the effect of choice of overrelaxation factors on the speed of convergence was investigated. A clearly improved 3D resolution was obtained by axial tomography together with reconstruction as compared with reconstruction of confocal data from only a single angular view.},

abstract = {A programmable array microscope (PAM) incorporates a spatial light modulator (SLM) placed in the primary image plane of a widefield microscope, where it is used to define patterns of illumination and/or detection. We describe the characteristics of a special type of PAM collecting two images simultaneously. The conjugate image (Ic) is formed by light originating from the object plane and returning along the optical path of the illumination light. The non-conjugate image (Inc) receives light from only those regions of the SLM that are not used for illuminating the sample. The dual-signal PAM provides much more time-efficient excitation than the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and greater utilization of the available emission light. It has superior noise characteristics in comparison to single-sided instruments. The axial responses of the system under a variety of conditions were measured and the behaviour of the novel Inc image characterized. As in systems in which only Ic images are collected (Nipkow-disc microscopes, and previously characterized PAMs), the axial response to thin fluorescent films showed a sharpening of the axial response as the unit cell of the repetitive patterns decreased in size. The dual-signal PAM can be adapted to a wide range of data analysis and collection strategies. We investigated systematically the effects of patterns and unit cell dimensions on the axial response. Sufficiently sparse patterns lead to an Ic image formed by the superposition of the many parallel beams, each of which is equivalent to the single scanning spot of a CLSM. The sectioning capabilities of the system, as given by its axial responses, were similar for a given scan pattern and for processed pseudorandom sequence (PRS) scans with the same size of the unit cell. For the PRS scans, optical sectioning was achieved by a subtraction of an Inc image or, alternatively, a scaled widefield image from the Ic image. Based on the comparative noise levels of the two methods, the non-conjugate subtraction was significantly superior. A point spread function for Ic and Inc was simulated and properties of the optical transfer functions (OTFs) were compared. Simulations of the OTF in non-conjugate imaging did not suffer from the missing cone problem, enabling a high quality deconvolution of the non-conjugate side alone. We also investigated the properties of images obtained by subjecting the Ic and Inc data to a combined maximum likelihood deconvolution.},

abstract = {Fluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy allows an improved imaging of microscopic objects in three dimensions. However, the resolution along the axial direction is three times worse than the resolution in lateral directions. A method to overcome this axial limitation is tilting the object under the microscope, in a way that the direction of the optical axis points into different directions relative to the sample. A new technique for a simultaneous reconstruction from a number of such axial tomographic confocal data sets was developed and used for high resolution reconstruction of 3D-data both from experimental and virtual microscopic data sets. The reconstructed images have a highly improved 3D resolution, which is comparable to the lateral resolution of a single deconvolved data set. Axial tomographic imaging in combination with simultaneous data reconstruction also opens the possibility for a more precise quantification of 3D data. The color images of this publication can be accessed from http://www.esacp.org/acp/2000/20-1/heintzmann.++ +htm.

Here we report on a novel double-pass FTIS system, that is capable of obtaining an excitation as well as an emission spectrum of the fluorescent sample with only a single sweep of the interferometer. This is achieved by modifying an existing FTIS system, placing the excitation source before the interferometer so as to spectrally modulate the excitation as well as the detection. An analysis of the acquired signal allows for the reconstruction of the excitation as well as the emission spectrum of each fluorophore assuming an independence of the two spectra for each fluorophore. Due to the patterned excitation generated by the Sagnac interferometer a substantial degree of optically sectioning is achieved at excitation wavelengths. Further analysis of the acquired data also enables the generation of optically sectioned emission images. A theoretical analysis and experimental data based on fluorescent beads are presented.},

abstract = {The resolution of optical microscopy is limited by the numerical aperture and the wavelength of light. Many strategies for improving resolution such as 4Pi and I5M have focused on an increase of the numerical aperture. Other approaches have based resolution improvement in fluorescence microscopy on the establishment of a nonlinear relationship between local excitation light intensity in the sample and in the emitted light. However, despite their innovative character, current techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED) and ground-state depletion (GSD) microscopy require complex optical configurations and instrumentation to narrow the point-spread function. We develop the theory of nonlinear patterned excitation microscopy for achieving a substantial improvement in resolution by deliberate saturation of the fluorophore excited state. The postacquisition manipulation of the acquired data is computationally more complex than in STED or GSD, but the experimental requirements are simple. Simulations comparing saturated patterned excitation microscopy with linear patterned excitation microscopy (also referred to in the literature as structured illumination or harmonic excitation light microscopy) and ordinary widefield microscopy are presented and discussed. The effects of photon noise are included in the simulations.},

abstract = {Subtractive imaging in confocal fluorescence light microscopy is based on the subtraction of a suitably weighted widefield image from a confocal image. An approximation to a widefield image can be obtained by detection with an opened confocal pinhole. The subtraction of images enhances the resolution in-plane as well as along the optic axis. Due to the linearity of the approach, the effect of subtractive imaging in Fourier-space corresponds to a reduction of low spatial frequency contributions leading to a relative enhancement of the high frequencies. Along the direction of the optic axis this also results in an improved sectioning. Image processing can achieve a similar effect. However, a 3D volume dataset must be acquired and processed, yielding a result essentially identical to subtractive imaging but superior in signal-to-noise ratio. The latter can be increased further with the technique of weighted averaging in Fourier-space. A comparison of 2D and 3D experimental data analysed with subtractive imaging, the equivalent Fourier-space processing of the confocal data only, and Fourier-space weighted averaging is presented.},

abstract = {During the past 50 years, the high acoustic sensitivity and the echolocation behavior of dolphins and other small odontocetes have been studied thoroughly. However, understanding has been scarce as to how the dolphin cochlea is stimulated by high frequency echoes, and likewise regarding the ear mechanics affecting dolphin audiograms. The characteristic impedance of mammalian soft tissues is similar to that of water, and thus no radical refractions of sound, nor reflections of sound, can be expected at the water/soft tissue interfaces. Consequently, a sound-collecting terrestrial pinna and an outer ear canal serve little purpose in underwater hearing. Additionally, compared to terrestrial mammals whose middle ear performs an impedance match from air to the cochlea, the impedance match performed by the odontocete middle ear needs to be reversed to perform an opposite match from water to the cochlea. In this paper, we discuss anatomical adaptations of dolphins: a lower jaw collecting sound, thus replacing the terrestrial outer ear pinna, and a thin and large tympanic bone plate replacing the tympanic membrane of terrestrial mammals. The paper describes the lower jaw anatomy and hypothetical middle ear mechanisms explaining both the high sensitivity and the converted acoustic impedance match.},

The development of fluorescent markers in parallel with super-resolution imaging systems has pushed light microscopy into the realm of molecular visualization at the nanometer scale. Resolutions previously only attained with electron microscopes are now within the grasp of light microscopes. However, until recently, live-cell imaging approaches have eluded super-resolution microscopy, hampering it from reaching its full potential for revealing the dynamic interactions in biology occurring at the single molecule level. Here we examine recent advances in the super-resolution imaging of living cells by reviewing recent breakthroughs in single molecule localization microscopy methods such as PALM and STORM to achieve this important goal.},

Resolution improvement by a factor of two can be achieved using structured illumination, where a fine grating is projected onto the sample, and the final image is reconstructed from a set of images taken at different grating positions. Here we demonstrate that with the help of a spatial light modulator, this technique can be used for imaging slowly moving structures in living cells.},

We compare 3D reconstructions of the guinea pig inner ear, using light microscopy and orthogonal plane fluorescence optical sectioning microscopy. Applications of 3D reconstruction of the inner ear are further explored. For each method two bullas were prepared for 3D reconstruction. Both methods are explained. In general, the 3D reconstructions using orthogonal plane fluorescence optical sectioning microscopy are superior to light microscopy. The exact spiral shape of the cochlea could be reconstructed using orthogonal plane fluorescence optical sectioning microscopy and the length of the basilar membrane measured. When a resolution of 20 microm is sufficient, orthogonal plane fluorescence optical sectioning microscopy is a superior technique for 3D reconstruction of inner ear structures in animals.},

abstract = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures.},

optical

imaging techniques because of their absorptive and scattering properties.

We developed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to generate

multidimensional images of samples up to a few millimeters in size.
The

system combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-

based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imaging

throughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capable

of capturing transient biological phenomena. We used SPIM to visualize
all

muscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses
green

fluorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that SPIM
can be

applied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila

melanogaster in vivo.},

abstract = {A case of idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is reported in a 38-year-old man who had been diagnosed with SLE and treated for 18 years. Esophageal varices. found in 1994 on endoscopic examination, had been followed up for 2 years. On July 16, 1996, he was admitted to Nagoya University Hospital because there was a high risk of bleeding from the esophageal varices due to severe thrombocytopenia. As partial splenic embolization had temporarily controlled the thrombocytopenia, splenectomy and devascularization of the stomach vessels were performed after endoscopic ligation of the esophageal varices. Histological specimens of wedge biopsied liver showed chronic inactive hepatitis without cirrhosis. The presence of anticardiolipin antibody, indicated by positivity for lupus anticoagulant, was suggestive of the presence of a common immunological mechanism in the etiology of SLE and IPH.},

abstract = {Light microscopy of thick biological samples, such as tissues, is often limited by aberrations caused by refractive index variations within the sample itself. This problem is particularly severe for live imaging, a field of great current excitement due to the development of inherently fluorescent proteins. We describe a method of removing such aberrations computationally by mapping the refractive index of the sample using differential interference contrast microscopy, modeling the aberrations by ray tracing through this index map, and using space-variant deconvolution to remove aberrations. This approach will open possibilities to study weakly labeled molecules in difficult-to-image live specimens.},

Unfortunately the image quality of fluorescence microscopes is often significantly degraded due to aberrations that occur under normal imaging conditions. In this article, we examine the use of adaptive optics technology to dynamically correct these problems to achieve close to ideal diffraction limited performance. Simultaneously, this technology also allows ultra-rapid focusing without having to move either the stage or the objective lens. We perform optical simulations to demonstrate the degree of correction that can be achieved.},

abstract = {Recording light-microscopy images of large, nontransparent specimens, such as developing multicellular organisms, is complicated by decreased contrast resulting from light scattering. Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo.},

abstract = {The Japanese Urological Association has developed Clinical Guidelines for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) for men with suspected BPH, which have been abridged and translated into English. This article is a shortened version of the English translation. The Guidelines were formulated on the basis of evidence retrieved from the PubMed database between 1995 and 2009, as well as other relevant sources. The target patients of these Guidelines are men with suspected BPH, and the target users are urologists. A mandatory assessment should include a medical history, a physical examination, the completion of symptom and quality of life questionnaires, urinalysis, prostate ultrasonography, measurement of serum prostate specific antigen and postvoid residual urine, and an uroflowmetry. Optional tests include a bladder diary, the measurement of serum creatinine, and upper urinary tract ultrasonography. Care should be taken to not overlook coexisting diseases such as an infection or malignancy that may obscure the diagnosis. Treatment should consist of conservative therapy or the use of medications such as $\alpha$(1) -adrenoceptor antagonists, or both. The use of 5$\alpha$-reductase inhibitors or anticholinergic agents should be considered in patients with an enlarged prostate (>30 mL) or overactive bladder symptoms (overactive bladder symptom score ≥ 6), respectively. Surgical intervention is indicated when non-surgical treatments fail to provide sufficient symptomatic relief and bladder outlet obstruction is highly suspected.},

abstract = {Live-cell microscopy imaging of fluorescent-tagged fusion proteins
is an essential tool for cell biologists. Total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) has joined confocal microscopy as
a complementary system for the imaging of cell surface protein dynamics
in mammalian and yeast systems because of its high temporal and spatial
resolution. Here we present an alternative to TIRFM, termed variable-angle
epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM), for the visualization of protein
dynamics at or near the plasma membrane of plant epidermal cells
and root hairs in whole, intact seedlings that provides high-signal,
low-background and near real-time imaging. VAEM uses highly oblique
subcritical incident angles to decrease background fluorophore excitation.
We discuss the utilities and advantages of VAEM for imaging of fluorescent
fusion-tagged marker proteins in studying cortical cytoskeletal and
membrane proteins. We believe that the application of VAEM will be
an invaluable imaging tool for plant cell biologists.},

abstract = {An optical ruler based on ultrahigh-resolution colocalization of single fluorescent probes is described in this paper. It relies on the use of two unique families of fluorophores, namely energy-transfer fluorescent beads (TransFluoSpheres) and semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots, that can be excited by a single laser wavelength but emit at different wavelengths. A multicolor sample-scanning confocal microscope was constructed that allows one to image each fluorescent light emitter, free of chromatic aberrations, by scanning the sample with nanometer scale steps with a piezo-scanner. The resulting spots are accurately localized by fitting them to the known shape of the excitation point-spread function of the microscope. We present results of two-dimensional colocalization of TransFluoSpheres (40 nm in diameter) and of nanocrystals (3-10 nm in diameter) and demonstrate distance-measurement accuracy of better than 10 nm using conventional far-field optics. This ruler bridges the gap between fluorescence resonance energy transfer, near- and far-field imaging, spanning a range of a few nanometers to tens of micrometers.},

abstract = {Summary By inserting a microlens array at the intermediate image plane
of an optical microscope, one can record four-dimensional light fields
of biological specimens in a single snapshot. Unlike a conventional
photograph, light fields permit manipulation of viewpoint and focus
after the snapshot has been taken, subject to the resolution of the
camera and the diffraction limit of the optical system. By inserting
a second microlens array and video projector into the microscope's
illumination path, one can control the incident light field falling
on the specimen in a similar way. In this paper, we describe a prototype
system we have built that implements these ideas, and we demonstrate
two applications for it: simulating exotic microscope illumination
modalities and correcting for optical aberrations digitally.},

abstract = {By inserting a microlens array into the optical train of a conventional
microscope, one can capture light ﬁelds of biological

specimens in a single photograph. Although diffraction places a

limit on the product of spatial and angular resolution in these light

ﬁelds, we can nevertheless produce useful perspective views and

focal stacks from them. Since microscopes are inherently orthographic
devices, perspective views represent a new way to look at

microscopic specimens. The ability to create focal stacks from a

single photograph allows moving or light-sensitive specimens to

be recorded. Applying 3D deconvolution to these focal stacks, we

can produce a set of cross sections, which can be visualized using

volume rendering. In this paper, we demonstrate a prototype light

ﬁeld microscope (LFM), analyze its optical performance, and

show perspective views, focal stacks, and reconstructed volumes

for a variety of biological specimens. We also show that synthetic

focusing followed by 3D deconvolution is equivalent to applying

limited-angle tomography directly to the 4D light ﬁeld.},

abstract = {The erbB/HER family of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) mediate cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and related ligands. We have imaged the early stages of RTK-dependent signaling in living cells using: (i) stable expression of erbB1/2/3 fused with visible fluorescent proteins (VFPs), (ii) fluorescent quantum dots (QDs) bearing epidermal growth factor (EGF-QD) and (iii) continuous confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. Here we demonstrate that EGF-QDs are highly specific and potent in the binding and activation of the EGF receptor (erbB1), being rapidly internalized into endosomes that exhibit active trafficking and extensive fusion. EGF-QDs bound to erbB1 expressed on filopodia revealed a previously unreported mechanism of retrograde transport to the cell body. When erbB2-monomeric yellow fluorescent protein (mYFP) or erbB3-monomeric Citrine (mCitrine) were coexpressed with erbB1, the rates and extent of endocytosis of EGF-QD and the RTK-VFP demonstrated that erbB2 but not erbB3 heterodimerizes with erbB1 after EGF stimulation, thereby modulating EGF-induced signaling. QD-ligands will find widespread use in basic research and biotechnological developments.},

abstract = {We describe a method of obtaining optical sectioning with a standard
wide-field fluorescence microscope. The method involves acquiring
two images, one with nonuniform illumination (in our case, speckle)
and another with uniform illumination (in our case, randomized speckle).
An evaluation of the local contrast in the speckle-illumination image
provides an optically sectioned image with low resolution. This is
complemented with high-resolution information obtained from the uniform-illumination
image. A fusion of both images leads to a full resolution image that
is optically sectioned across all spatial frequencies. This hybrid
illumination method is fast, robust, and generalizable to a variety
of illumination and imaging configurations. (c) 2008 Optical Society

Confocal microscopy allows high-resolution visualisation of a variety of fluorescent and fluorescently tagged molecules in both fixed and living cells, not only in single cells but also in intact tissues. Confocal microscopes greatly improve image quality by reducing interference by out-of-focus light and can capture high-resolution serial optical sections through samples in the z-axis. In combination with a range of computational image analysis techniques, confocal microscopy provides a powerful tool by which molecules, molecular interactions, and cell components can be localised and studied.},

lens–based and point-scanning illumination systems. Here we describe
a novel microscope configuration that incorporates a nematic liquid
crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) to generate holographic
patterns of illumination. This microscope can produce illumination
spots of variable size and number and patterns shaped to precisely
match user-defined elements in a specimen. Using holographic illumination
to photolyse caged glutamate in brain slices, we demonstrate that
shaped excitation on segments of neuronal dendrites and simultaneous,
multi-spot excitation of different dendrites enables precise spatial
and rapid temporal control of glutamate receptor activation. By allowing
the excitation volume shape to be tailored precisely, the holographic
microscope provides an extremely flexible method for activation of
various photosensitive proteins and small molecules.},

abstract = {A radically new CCD development by Marconi Applied Technologies has enabled substantial internal gain within the CCD before the signal reaches the output amplifier. With reasonably high gain, sub-electron readout noise levels are achieved even at MHz pixel rates. This paper reports a detailed assessment of these devices, including novel methods of measuring their properties when operated at peak mean signal levels well below one electron per pixel. The devices are shown to be photon shot noise limited at essentially all light levels below saturation. Even at the lowest signal levels the charge transfer efficiency is good. The conclusion is that these new devices have radically changed the balance in the perpetual trade-off between readout noise and the speed of readout. They will force a re-evaluation of camera technologies and imaging strategies to enable the maximum benefit to be gained from these high-speed, essentially noiseless readout devices. This new LLLCCD technology, in conjunction with thinning (backside illumination) should provide detectors which will be very close indeed to being theoretically perfect. 1.},

abstract = {We analyze the performance of a ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon display (FLCoS) as a binary polarization diffraction grating. We analyze the correspondence between the two polarization states emerging from the displayed grating and the polarization and intensity of the diffracted orders generated at the Fourier diffraction plane. This polarization-diffraction analysis leads, in a simple manner, to configurations yielding binary amplitude or binary phase modulation by incorporating an analyzer on the reflected beam. Based on this analysis, we present two useful variations of the polarization configuration. The first is a simplification using a single polarizer, which provides equivalent results for amplitude or phase modulation as the more general operational mode involving two polarizers. The second variation is proposed to compensate the reduction of the diffraction efficiency when the operating wavelength differs from the design one (for which the FLCoS liquid-crystal layer acts as a half-wave plate). In this situation we show how the ideal grating performance can be recovered in spite of the phase-shift mismatch originated by chromatic dispersion. In all cases, we provide experimental results that verify the theoretical analyses.},

We survey the vast terrain of 'culturomics,' focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

@article{Mlodzianoski2011,
abstract = {The recent development of diffraction-unlimited far-field fluorescence microscopy has overcome the classical resolution limit of \~{}250 nm of conventional light microscopy by about a factor of ten. The improved resolution, however, reveals not only biological structures at an unprecedented resolution, but is also susceptible to sample drift on a much finer scale than previously relevant. Without correction, sample drift leads to smeared images with decreased resolution, and in the worst case to misinterpretation of the imaged structures. This poses a problem especially for techniques such as Fluorescence Photoactivation Localization Microscopy (FPALM/PALM) or Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), which often require minutes recording time. Here we discuss an approach that corrects for three-dimensional (3D) drift in images of fixed samples without the requirement for fiduciary markers or instrument modifications. Drift is determined by calculating the spatial cross-correlation function between subsets of localized particles imaged at different times. Correction down to \~{}5 nm precision is achieved despite the fact that different molecules are imaged in each frame. We demonstrate the performance of our drift correction algorithm with different simulated structures and analyze its dependence on particle density and localization precision. By imaging mitochondria with Biplane FPALM we show our algorithm's feasibility in a practical application.},

abstract = {Deformable models (e.g., snakes) perform poorly in many image analysis problems. The contour model is attracted by edge points detected in the image. However, many edge points do not belong to the object contour, preventing the active contour from converging toward the object boundary. A new algorithm is proposed in this paper to overcome this difficulty. The algorithm is based on two key ideas. First, edge points are associated in strokes. Second, each stroke is classified as valid (inlier) or invalid (outlier) and a confidence degree is associated to each stroke. The expectation maximization algorithm is used to update the confidence degrees and to estimate the object contour. It is shown that this is equivalent to the use of an adaptive potential function which varies during the optimization process. Valid strokes receive high confidence degrees while confidence degrees of invalid strokes tend to zero during the optimization process. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in the presence of clutter, showing a remarkable robustness.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a rigorous and general theoretical model for the illumination point spread function of a confocal microscope that correctly reproduces the optical setup. The model uses vectorial theory and assumes that monochromatic light with a Gaussian intensity distribution (such as from a laser or a single-mode fiber) is focused by a microscope objective with high numerical aperture and passes through stratified media on its way to the sample. This covers the important practical case of illumination through up to three layers, which is the situation most commonly encountered in biological microscopy (immersion oil, glass coverslip, aqueous sample medium). It also accounts for objectives that are corrected for a certain coverslip thickness and refractive index but operated under non-design conditions. Furthermore, illumination with linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized light is covered by introducing a Babinet-Soleil compensator into the beam path. The model leads to a set of analytical equations that are readily evaluated. Two-dimensional intensity distributions for particular cases of interest are presented and discussed.},

To obtain high speed and highly flexible beam steering, a two-axis acousto-optic deflector is employed. However, dispersion associated with acoustic-optic interaction will cause serious spatial deformation on the writing spot. The compensation for dispersion is proposed and studied. Experiments show promising results. An additional advantage of the proposed compensation method is that it can also precisely control the pulse number, and, hence improve the quality of ablation.},

@article{Nikolenko2008,
abstract = {Laser microscopy has generally poor temporal resolution, caused by the serial scanning of each pixel. This is a significant problem for imaging or optically manipulating neural circuits, since neuronal activity is fast. To help surmount this limitation, we have developed a "scanless" microscope that does not contain mechanically moving parts. This microscope uses a diffractive spatial light modulator (SLM) to shape an incoming two-photon laser beam into any arbitrary light pattern. This allows the simultaneous imaging or photostimulation of different regions of a sample with three-dimensional precision. To demonstrate the usefulness of this microscope, we perform two-photon uncaging of glutamate to activate dendritic spines and cortical neurons in brain slices. We also use it to carry out fast (60 Hz) two-photon calcium imaging of action potentials in neuronal populations. Thus, SLM microscopy appears to be a powerful tool for imaging and optically manipulating neurons and neuronal circuits. Moreover, the use of SLMs expands the flexibility of laser microscopy, as it can substitute traditional simple fixed lenses with any calculated lens function.},

advantages of laser-scanning microscopy. This introduces, however,
a

number of difﬁculties due to the scanning process, such as lower frame

rates due to the serial acquisition process. Here we show that by
introducing

spatiotemporal pulse shaping techniques to multiphoton microscopy
it is

possible to obtain full-frame depth resolved imaging completely without

scanning. Our method relies on temporal focusing of the illumination
pulse.

The pulsed excitation ﬁeld is compressed as it propagates through
the

sample, reaching its shortest duration at the focal plane, before
stretching

again beyond it. This method is applied to obtain depth-resolved twophoton
excitation ﬂuorescence (TPEF) images of drosophila egg-chambers with
nearly 10\^{}5 effective pixels using a standard Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator},

abstract = {Two-photon microscopy offers the promise of monitoring brain activity
at multiple locations within intact tissue. However, serial sampling
of voxels has been difficult to reconcile with millisecond timescales
characteristic of neuronal activity. This is due to the conflicting
constraints of scanning speed and signal amplitude. The recent use
of acousto-optic deflector scanning to implement random-access multiphoton
microscopy (RAMP) potentially allows to preserve long illumination
dwell times while sampling multiple points-of-interest at high rates.
However, the real-life abilities of RAMP microscopy regarding sensitivity
and phototoxicity issues, which have so far impeded prolonged optical
recordings at high frame rates, have not been assessed. Here, we
describe the design, implementation and characterisation of an optimised
RAMP microscope. We demonstrate the application of the microscope
by monitoring calcium transients in Purkinje cells and cortical pyramidal
cell dendrites and spines. We quantify the illumination constraints
imposed by phototoxicity and show that stable continuous high-rate
recordings can be obtained. During these recordings the fluorescence
signal is large enough to detect spikes with a temporal resolution
limited only by the calcium dye dynamics, improving upon previous
techniques by at least an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Light-gated ion channels and pumps have made it possible to probe
intact neural circuits by manipulating the activity of groups of
genetically similar neurons. What is needed now is a method for precisely
aiming the stimulating light at single neuronal processes, neurons
or groups of neurons. We developed a method that combines generalized
phase contrast with temporal focusing (TF-GPC) to shape two-photon
excitation for this purpose. The illumination patterns are generated
automatically from fluorescence images of neurons and shaped to cover
the cell body or dendrites, or distributed groups of cells. The TF-GPC
two-photon excitation patterns generated large photocurrents in Channelrhodopsin-2-expressing
cultured cells and neurons and in mouse acute cortical slices. The
amplitudes of the photocurrents can be precisely modulated by controlling
the size and shape of the excitation volume and, thereby, be used
to trigger single action potentials or trains of action potentials.},

abstract = {Image analysis algorithms are often highly parameterized and much human input is needed to optimize parameter settings. This incurs a time cost of up to several days. We analyze and characterize the conventional parameter optimization process for image analysis and formulate user requirements. With this as input, we propose a change in paradigm by optimizing parameters based on parameter sampling and interactive visual exploration. To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step--initialization of sampling--and the last step--visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler--a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm. To find optimal parameter settings, users can tag high- and low-quality results to refine their search. We include two case studies to illustrate the utility of this approach.},

abstract = {The dynamic ability of neuronal dendrites to shape and integrate synaptic responses is the hallmark of information processing in the brain. Effectively studying this phenomenon requires concurrent measurements at multiple sites on live neurons. Significant progress has been made by optical imaging systems which combine confocal and multiphoton microscopy with inertia-free laser scanning. However, all systems developed to date restrict fast imaging to two dimensions. This severely limits the extent to which neurons can be studied, since they represent complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. Here we present a novel imaging system that utilizes a unique arrangement of acousto-optic deflectors to steer a focused ultra-fast laser beam to arbitrary locations in 3D space without moving the objective lens. As we demonstrate, this highly versatile random-access multiphoton microscope supports functional imaging of complex 3D cellular structures such as neuronal dendrites or neural populations at acquisition rates on the order of tens of kilohertz.},

abstract = {When artists portray human faces, they generally endow their portraits with properties that render the faces esthetically more pleasing. To obtain insight into the changes introduced by artists, we compared Fourier power spectra in photographs of faces and in portraits by artists. Our analysis was restricted to a large set of monochrome or lightly colored portraits from various Western cultures and revealed a paradoxical result. Although face photographs are not scale-invariant, artists draw human faces with statistical properties that deviate from the face photographs and approximate the scale-invariant, fractal-like properties of complex natural scenes. This result cannot be explained by systematic differences in the complexity of patterns surrounding the faces or by reproduction artifacts. In particular, a moderate change in gamma gradation has little influence on the results. Moreover, the scale-invariant rendering of faces in artists' portraits was found to be independent of cultural variables, such as century of origin or artistic techniques. We suggest that artists have implicit knowledge of image statistics and prefer natural scene statistics (or some other rules associated with them) in their creations. Fractal-like statistics have been demonstrated previously in other forms of visual art and may be a general attribute of esthetic visual stimuli.},

abstract = {We have developed confocal multicolor single-molecule spectroscopy with optimized detection sensitivity on three spectrally distinct channels for the study of biomolecular interactions and FRET between more than two molecules. Using programmable acousto-optical devices as beamsplitter and excitation filter, we overcome some of the limitations of conventional multichroic beamsplitters and implement rapid alternation between three laser lines. This enables to visualize the synthesis of DNA three-way junctions on a single-molecule basis and to resolve seven stoichiometric subpopulations as well as to quantify FRET in the presence of competing energy transfer pathways. Furthermore, the ability to study correlated molecular movements by monitoring several distances within a biomolecular complex simultaneously is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Advanced optical imaging techniques used in neurobiology commonly
employ fluorescent molecules for studying the structure and function
of neural tissue. To obtain adequate spatio-temporal resolution,
sophisticated scanning schemes are used to manage the excitation
light going to and emission light coming from objects under observation.
Although the fundamental principles of these techniques remain the
same, such as scanning point illumination and point detection for
confocal imaging, their physical implementation is the subject of
technological advance, for example, the advent of inertia-free discontinuous
scanning schemes. In general, the aims of these technological advances
are to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of and/or reduce potential
photodamage caused by optical imaging in live neural tissue. The
number of recent advances in scanning methods indicates their increasing
importance in imaging techniques.},

@article{Santi2011,
abstract = {Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) functions as a non-destructive
microtome and microscope that uses a plane of light to optically
section and view tissues with subcellular resolution. This method
is well suited for imaging deep within transparent tissues or within
whole organisms, and because tissues are exposed to only a thin plane
of light, specimen photobleaching and phototoxicity are minimized
compared to wide-field fluorescence, confocal, or multiphoton microscopy.
LSFMs produce well-registered serial sections that are suitable for
three-dimensional reconstruction of tissue structures. Because of
a lack of a commercial LSFM microscope, numerous versions of light
sheet microscopes have been constructed by different investigators.
This review describes development of the technology, reviews existing
devices, provides details of one LSFM device, and shows examples
of images and three-dimensional reconstructions of tissues that were
produced by LSFM.},

acquiring two images, one with grid-pattern illumination and another

with grid-pattern illumination provides an optically sectioned image
with low resolution. This is complemented with high-resolution information
from the uniform illumination image, leading to a full-resolution
image that is optically sectioned. HiLo endomicroscope movies are
presented of fluorescently labeled rat colonic mucosa. },

abstract = {Fluorescence light microscopy allows multicolor visualization of cellular components with high specificity, but its utility has until recently been constrained by the intrinsic limit of spatial resolution. We applied three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to circumvent this limit and to study the mammalian nucleus. By simultaneously imaging chromatin, nuclear lamina, and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), we observed several features that escape detection by conventional microscopy. We could resolve single NPCs that colocalized with channels in the lamin network and peripheral heterochromatin. We could differentially localize distinct NPC components and detect double-layered invaginations of the nuclear envelope in prophase as previously seen only by electron microscopy. Multicolor 3D-SIM opens new and facile possibilities to analyze subcellular structures beyond the diffraction limit of the emitted light.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {A new type of wide-field fluorescence microscopy is described, which produces 100-nm-scale spatial resolution in all three dimensions, by using structured illumination in a microscope that has two opposing objective lenses. Illumination light is split by a grating and a beam splitter into six mutually coherent beams, three of which enter the specimen through each objective lens. The resulting illumination intensity pattern contains high spatial frequency components both axially and laterally. In addition, the emission is collected by both objective lenses coherently, and combined interferometrically on a single camera, resulting in a detection transfer function with axially extended support. These two effects combine to produce near-isotropic resolution. Experimental images of test samples and biological specimens confirm the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we report a method for 3D visualization of a biological specimen utilizing a structured light wide-field microscopic imaging system. This method improves on existing structured light imaging modalities by reassigning fluorescence photons generated from off-focal plane excitation, improving in-focus signal strength. Utilizing a maximum likelihood approach, we identify the most likely fluorophore distribution in 3D that will produce the observed image stacks under structured and uniform illumination using an iterative maximization algorithm. Our results show the optical sectioning capability of tissue specimens while mostly preserving image stack photon count, which is usually not achievable with other existing structured light imaging methods.},

abstract = {Widefield fluorescence microscopy is seeing dramatic improvements in resolution, reaching today 100 nm in all three dimensions. This gain in resolution is achieved by dispensing with uniform K\"{o}hler illumination. Instead, non-uniform excitation light patterns with sinusoidal intensity variations in one, two, or three dimensions are applied combined with powerful image reconstruction techniques. Taking advantage of non-linear fluorophore response to the excitation field, the resolution can be further improved down to several 10 nm. In this review article, we describe the image formation in the microscope and computational reconstruction of the high-resolution dataset when exciting the specimen with a harmonic light pattern conveniently generated by interfering laser beams forming standing waves. We will also discuss extensions to total internal reflection microscopy, non-linear microscopy, and three-dimensional imaging.},

just summing the photons and subtracting the background is a good technique (synthetic aperture photometry)

@article{Takahashi2009,
abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals can block photons in any direction and are expected to make possible their ultimate control. However, creating 3D crystals without any unintentional defects over large areas at optical wavelengths has been challenging. For example, opal-based crystals inevitably contain unintentional defects, it is difficult to increase the sizes of micro-manipulated crystals over approximately 6 microm and producing stacked 3D crystals with thin 2D layers requires complicated and time-consuming processes. So far, these difficulties have hindered 3D photonic-crystal research. Here, we demonstrate a novel top-down approach to creating 3D crystals that overcomes these difficulties and significantly simplifies the process. We have developed a double-angled deep-etching method, which enables the direct creation of 3D woodpile crystals in single-crystalline silicon. A strong photonic bandgap effect with >20 dB attenuation in all directions has been achieved. Furthermore, bonding a light emitter onto or between 3D crystals created in this way has been shown to enhance or suppress spontaneous emission.},

@article{Thompson2002,
abstract = {Calculation of the centroid of the images of individual fluorescent particles and molecules allows localization and tracking in light microscopes to a precision about an order of magnitude greater than the microscope resolution. The factors that limit the precision of these techniques are examined and a simple equation derived that describes the precision of localization over a wide range of conditions. In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares fitting theory is constructed and tested both on image stacks of 30-nm fluorescent beads and on computer-generated images (Monte Carlo simulations). Results from the algorithm show good agreement with the derived precision equation for both the simulations and actual images. The availability of a simple equation to describe localization precision helps investigators both in assessing the quality of an experimental apparatus and in directing attention to the factors that limit further improvement. The precision of localization scales as the inverse square root of the number of photons in the spot for the shot noise limited case and as the inverse of the number of photons for the background noise limited case. The optimal image magnification depends on the expected number of photons and background noise, but, for most cases of interest, the pixel size should be about equal to the standard deviation of the point spread function.},

The full dielectric permittivity tensor is considered in solving Maxwell's equations. The wide applicability of the method is illustrated with different examples: the propagation of a laser beam in a uniaxial medium, the tunability of a directional coupler based on liquid crystals and the near-field diffraction of a plane wave in a structure containing micrometer scale variations in the transverse refractive index, similar to the pixels of a spatial light modulator.},

abstract = {The Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) Initiative offers a unique opportunity to conduct large-scale, multisite, multilevel program evaluation in the context of a federal environment that places many requirements and constraints on how the grants are conducted and managed. Federal programs stress performance-based outcomes, valid and reliable data, addressing important problems, ensuring efficiency and fiscal responsibility, reducing burden on federal staff and grantees, and developing and disseminating useful solutions and recommendations. MANILA Consulting Group, Inc., (MANILA), in partnership with Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation (Battelle) and RMC Research Corporation (RMC), has been conducting the SS/HS national cross-site evaluation, which involves the coordinated efforts of federal Project Officers, local education agencies, technical assistance providers, communication specialists, and national and local evaluators across a diverse set of socioeconomic and cultural contexts. To date, the national cross-site evaluation has provided data indicating that the SS/HS Initiative is, in fact, meeting these goals. Findings revealed that fewer students reported they had experienced violence and fewer students reported they had witnessed violence. Fully 96 percent of school staff said SS/HS had improved school safety. There was a 263 percent increase in the number of students who received school-based mental health services and a 519 percent increase in those receiving community-based mental health services. In addition, more than 80 percent of school staff reported that they saw reductions in alcohol and other drug use among their students. These encouraging results stress the need for ongoing coordination at all levels of the Initiative to continue to ensure safer schools and healthier students. This article provides an overview of the initiative and introduces four articles in this special issue.},

abstract = {In the past few decades, technology has made immeasurable strides to enable visualization, identification, and quantitation in biological systems. Many of these technological advancements are occurring on the nanometer scale, where multiple scientific disciplines are combining to create new materials with enhanced properties. The integration of inorganic synthetic methods with a size reduction to the nano-scale has lead to the creation of a new class of optical reporters, called quantum dots. These semiconductor quantum dot nanocrystals have emerged as an alternative to organic dyes and fluorescent proteins, and are brighter and more stable against photobleaching than standard fluorescent indicators. Quantum dots have tunable optical properties that have proved useful in a wide range of applications from multiplexed analysis such as DNA detection and cell sorting and tracking, to most recently demonstrating promise for in vivo imaging and diagnostics. This review provides an in-depth discussion of past, present, and future trends in quantum dot use with an emphasis on in vivo imaging and its related applications.},

abstract = {In this paper, polar and spherical Fourier Analysis are defined as the decomposition of a function in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with the eigenfunctions being separable in the corresponding coordinates. Each eigenfunction represents a basic pattern with the wavenumber in- dicating the scale. The proposed transforms provide an effective radial decomposition in addition to the well-known angular decomposition. The derivation of the basis functions is compactly presented with an emphasis on the analogy to the normal Fourier transform. The relation between the polar or spherical Fourier transform and normal Fourier transform is explored. Possible applications of the proposed transforms are discussed.},

abstract = {In the dolphin Tursiops truncatus, the basilar membrane over its course its course from basal to apical ends shows a systematic variation in width and in the manner and rigidity of its suspension. The suspension is by bony laminae on both the outer and inner edges in the basal region, and by progressively less rigid attachments in the more apical regions, until near the apex the membrane is held only by connective tissue. The basilar membrane shows an unusual variation in width of 14 times, ranging from an astonishingly small value of 25 mum at the basal end to a value toward the apex of about 350 mum. This structural variation is in harmony with the extension of sensitivity of the dolphin ear into the very high frequencies, and suggests unusual capabilities of pitch discrimination in this high range.},

abstract = {We present a method for increasing the lateral resolution and detection efficiency of scanning fluorescence microscopes by adding an interferometer with partial image inversion to the detection pathway. We show that the resulting detection transfer function is essentially the absolute square of the system's amplitude transfer function enlarged to twice its spatial frequency range. Simulations for a confocal system yield a lateral FWHM resolution of 168 nm (135 nm after image subtraction) as compared to 218 nm for confocal detection without an interferometer. Furthermore we demonstrate how this method is suitable for extended focus imaging. Here simulations for Bessel beam excitation and interferometric detection yield a resolution of 146 nm (116 nm after image subtraction) as compared to 199 nm for integrating detection without an interferometer.},

@article{Wolter2010,
abstract = {In the recent past, single-molecule based localization or photoswitching microscopy methods such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) or photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) have been successfully implemented for subdiffraction-resolution fluorescence imaging. However, the computational effort needed to localize numerous fluorophores is tremendous, causing long data processing times and thereby limiting the applicability of the technique. Here we present a new computational scheme for data processing consisting of noise reduction, detection of likely fluorophore positions, high-precision fluorophore localization and subsequent visualization of found fluorophore positions in a super-resolution image. We present and benchmark different algorithms for noise reduction and demonstrate the use of non-maximum suppression to quickly find likely fluorophore positions in high depth and very noisy images. The algorithm is evaluated and compared in terms of speed, accuracy and robustness by means of simulated data. On real biological samples, we find that real-time data processing is possible and that super-resolution imaging with organic fluorophores of cellular structures with approximately 20 nm optical resolution can be completed in less than 10 s.},

abstract = {Advanced light microscopy offers sensitive and non-invasive means
to image neural activity and to control signaling with photolysable
molecules and, recently, light-gated channels. These approaches require
precise and yet flexible light excitation patterns. For synchronous
stimulation of subsets of cells, they also require large excitation
areas with millisecond and micrometric resolution. We have recently
developed a new method for such optical control using a phase holographic
modulation of optical wave-fronts, which minimizes power loss, enables
rapid switching between excitation patterns, and allows a true 3D
sculpting of the excitation volumes. In previous studies we have
used holographic photololysis to control glutamate uncaging on single
neuronal cells. Here, we extend the use of holographic photolysis
for the excitation of multiple neurons and of glial cells.},

abstract = {Fat bodies in the heads of toothed whales, which serve to transmit and receive sound, represent extraordinary examples of physiological specialization in adipose tissues among mammals, yet we know surprisingly little about their biochemical composition. We describe the spatial distributions and development of unusual endogenous lipids (branched-chain ["iso"] molecules and wax esters) in the mandibular fat bodies of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) using an ontogenetic series (fetus to adult; n = 10). Although concentrations of iso-acids, iso-alcohols and waxes were lower in younger dolphins than in adults, the same relative spatial arrangement was present in all age classes, implying a set "pattern" of acoustic lipid distribution that is established very early in life. In all age classes, a small region of blubber overlying the lateral region contained unusually high concentrations of iso-acids, exhibiting a tenfold increase over "normal" adjacent blubber. Being chemically more similar to the acoustic fat bodies, this region may serve as an entry point for sound into the head. Developmental accumulations of some iso-acids and iso-alcohols occurred more rapidly than others, implying that not only are the spatial distributions of branched-chain molecules under extremely fine-scale control, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling acoustic lipid synthesis are also highly complex.},

abstract = {We report on the experimental observation of "focus splitting" when light is tightly focused into a uniaxial lithium niobate crystal along its optical axis. This effect consists in the focal spot being split into two major sub-peaks along the axial direction. For the microfabrication applications such as three-dimensional photonic crystal fabrication and waveguide writing, this effect is highly undesired since it can lead to the generation of multiple distinct voxels in the vicinity of the focus. The splitting is caused by different birefringence induced aberrations for the ordinary and extraordinary polarization eigenmodes. We present numerical simulations which support our observations and suggest methods to avoid this effect.},
