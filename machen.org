- ondrejs references each contain a cited on (with page number) that
  is useful

- language
  - thinlisp could have been used
  - note cling

- fluorescence
  - linear image formation allows deconvolution
  - refer to lithography, illumination simulation
  - quasi-monochromatic

- mma system
  - discuss, why circular window
  - rectangular window would allow to fill the camera properly
    - but it is more difficult to align


- discuss holography method
  - would higher resolution devices help?
  - linear response?
  - how many angles can be addressed
  - discuss speckle
  - (spatial) coherence of illumination

- quote mehta thesis
  - i should also call the mma condensor aperture slm
    - at ffp of condensor
  - use his expressions from page 24 to explain our dic setup
  - note that in future we should apply his quantitative theory to predicting the values
  - what is the patent for the dic method?
  - think about the phase difference maybe with bias and flat mirrors
    the algorithm that finds optimum positions is easier
  - what would happen in our case with a small shear?
  - argue that dic mma imaging is more 'linear', image doesn't depend
    on what is displayed
  - use kernel from p.39
  - we could use the mma illumination to implement dpc reflection mode
    with desired phase gradient contrast (p. 48)
    - he actually mentions slm here
    - its crucial to have gray level slm in condensor aperture
    - for matched illumination (S=1) the illumination must be linear
      - would dpc work in reflection? (i guess yes, but mehta doesn't mention)
      - discuss that this works very fast with our slm
      - but i'm not so sure how linear the slm with schlieren optics is
      - our problem: only small field

- geschwindigkeit dmd schneller als kamera
- stimmt aber nicht mehr
- wenn camera readnoise ein problem ist
- disadvantage:
  - weniger flexibel
  - leicht aliasing probleme
  - eigntlich abbildungsoptik von dmd auf kamera mit kamera pixeln samplenñ
    - kamera muessten 1/10 
    - na von mik zu dmd ist klein (im bild)
    - dmd hat scharfe pixel kanten und multipliziert mit gitter, imaging optik muss sehr grosse na haben (F=1, 45 grad detektion)

In this method spatiotemporal pulse shaping is used to ensure that the pulsed excitation field is compressed as it propagates through the sample, resulting in maximum axial compression in the focal slice, where it will thus reach its peak intensity. Because of the two-photon absorption’s quadratic dependence on the illumination intensity this leads to a wide-field sectioning effect.
