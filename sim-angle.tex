The objective of an optical microscope is defined by its support on
the Ewald sphere, i.e. the set of angles at which $k-$vectors
contribute to the image. In the following we assume an ideal air
objective with unit numerical aperture. This objective collects all
light emitted into one half space and therefor half the Ewald sphere.

The following code calculates the amplitude point spread function of
such an objective (see \figref{fig:simple-apsf}~right for a display of its
$x-z$~section).

\begin{verbatim}
n = 128;
nh = n/2;

% generate spherical shell in k-space
a = sinc(rr(n,n,n));
ka = ift(a);

% select top of the shell (NA=n):
ke = ka * (zz(ka)<0);

% show kx-kz section of ewald-sphere
ke(:,nh,:)

e = ift(ke);

% xz section of electric field
e(:,nh,:)
\end{verbatim}
% writeim(255/max(abs(ke(:,nh,:)))*abs(squeeze(ke(:,nh,:))),'/home/martin/thesis/kielhorn/sim-angle/ewald_xz.jpg','JPEG')
% writeim(255/max(abs(e(:,nh,:)))*abs(squeeze(e(:,nh,:))),'/home/martin/thesis/kielhorn/sim-angle/field_xz.jpg','JPEG')

If the microscope would contain no MMA but just the LCoS being
illuminated by a parallel plane, then the 3D field distribution in the
sample plane could be obtained by propagating the field from the LCoS
plane into the back focal plane of the objective (by a single 2D
Fourier transform). Then one multiplies each of the points of the
Ewald sphere with the corresponding complex value of the illumination
field. A 3D Fourier transform then results in the 3D field
distribution within the sample. By calculating the absolute square of
the field one obtains the 3D light intensity distribution in sample
space.

In the case of our spatio-angular microscope each of the pixels of the
MMA can be assumed to be an independent coherent source. In the
following code their fields are separately propagated into sample
space and then incoherently summed into the 3D intensity distribution.

The right picture in \figref{fig:sim-bfp-intens} displays an
$x-z$~section of the intensity distribution for the masks shown in in
\figref{fig:mma-lcos-window}. Note that the MMA window is shifted
slightly to the right. The intensity distribution clearly shows that
some angles are missing.

\begin{verbatim}
% define rectangular window as an lcos pattern
lcx = 0;
lcy = 10;
lw = 32;
lh = 32;
lsx = lcx-lw/2;
lex = lcx+lw/2;
lsy = lcy-lh/2;
ley = lcy+lh/2;
lcos= lsx<=xx(n,n) & xx(n,n)<lex & lsy<=yy(n,n) & yy(n,n)<ley

% define a circular window as an mma image (with quite low resolution)
mmazoom = 4;
mman = n / mmazoom;
mma = (xx(mman,mman)-3)^2+(yy(mman,mman)-0)^2 < 4^2

            % accumulate intensity image (incoherent)
