\section*{Preface}
\subsection*{Introduction}
In the work by \citet{Levoy2003}, a scene with a toy soldier behind a
plant is captured by a camera while being illuminated with sixteen
projectors.  Sophisticated illumination control allows them to
estimate a three-dimensional model of the scene and finally, they can
illuminate the toy without exposing the plant.

In our work we have adapted this idea for the field of fluorescence
microscopy. This is not as straightforward as it may seem.  The ideas
from \citet{Levoy2003} are based on ray optics and in extreme cases,
e.g.\ for very fine patterns, don't work for microscopes. Also, there
are related technical issues like the illumination, e.g.\ the light
source of a data projector usually doesn't have enough brightness to
illuminate a microscope efficiently.

Here we build a spatio-angular microscope. It contains two
programmable masks and can control the illumination angle for specific
spatial parts of the sample. The advantage of this microscope lies in
imaging of living samples with sparse, three-dimensionally extended
labelling.

In chapter \ref{sec:intro}, we introduce photophysics of fluorescence
and emphasize the importance of oxygen for phototoxicity. Furthermore,
we also explain conventional microscopes and CCD cameras.

In chapter \ref{sec:approaches}, we compare some state-of-the-art
techniques for illumination control in microscopes.  Particularly in
section \ref{sec:light-field-microscopy}, we discuss the micro-lens
based light field microscope by Levoy's computational photography
group, which imaged the toy soldier in 2003.

In chapter \ref{sec:setup}, we describe our microscope and in chapter
\ref{sec:experiments}, we show some images, taken with illumination
control in our prototype.

There is also an extensive appendix where we document more technical
issues like read noise calibration of a camera (Appendix
\ref{sec:ccd-meas}) or finding a rigid transform between a camera and
a display (Appendix \ref{sec:rigid}).

In the appendix, we also describe a completely different approach for
spatio--angular illumination based on holography (Appendix
\ref{sec:app_holo}) and we document an interferometric attempt to
convert our precise programmable phase mask into a spatial intensity
modulator (Appendix \ref{sec:app_dic}).

Note that the Appendix \ref{sec:dvi} describes a modification of our
prototype with a spatial light modulator that receives data from a
graphics card. A higher bandwidth makes this approach more useful than
the prototype described in the main text and we tried to implement
this first. However eventually, it proved too difficult to trigger the
components in this configuration and we switched to the more
predictable USB-controlled display as described in the main body of
the text.
 
The appendix also contains some theoretical explainations of
raytracing (Appendix \ref{sec:raytrace}), computational optical
sectioning (Appendix \ref{sec:app_hilo}) and the wave-optics based
simulation of our microscope (Appendix \ref{sec:sim-angle}).

\subsection*{Source Code Availability}

Source code that has been developed during this project is available
on \url{https://github.com/plops/mma}.  It contains implementations
for:
\begin{itemize}
\item illumination planning based on raytraces (see Appendix
  \ref{sec:raytrace})
\item moving the $z-$stage of a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope body
\item controlling an Andor Clara camera using the Andor SDK version
  2. For the other cameras following below, control software was written:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Photometrics Cascade~II (interface to unsupported
    closed-source driver, only works on very old 32-bit Linux kernels)
  \item mvBlueFox 102G using the SDK
  \item Logitech Pro 9000 using a generic Video4Linux interface
  \item Andor sCMOS using Andor SDK version 3
  \end{itemize}
\item displaying patterns using a graphics card that supports OpenGL
  on a ForthDD SXGA ferroelectric LCoS display
\item controlling a stand-alone ForthDD WXGA 3DM display controller
  using USB
\item estimating the parameters of a rigid transformation between
  camera and LCoS display (see Appendix \ref{sec:rigid}),
\item controlling the micro-mirror array by Fraunhofer IPMS using
  their SDK
\item some specific image processing tools:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item three-dimensional convolution and Fourier transforms
  \item drawing of lines and ellipsoids in volumes
  \item rasterization of triangles (for creating shadow maps in the
    BFP, see section \ref{sec:trace-detect})
  \item calculation of optical transfer function for high NA
    objectives
  \item localization of spherical nuclei in volumetric data (parts of
    the algorithm as described in \citet{Santella2010})
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The main development was done using GNU~Linux. However, portability
was kept in mind and most of the code was made to work with Microsoft
Windows as well.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
It is my pleasure to thank all those who have made this thesis
possible. First and foremost, I owe my deepest gratitude to my
supervisor Rainer Heintzmann for giving me the opportunity to become
part of his research group at King's College London and later in the
Institute of Photonic Technology in Jena.

I owe my sincere thanks to Kai Wicker, Jakub Nedbal, Susan Cox, Daniel
Appelt, Ond\v rej Mandula, Ronny F\"orster, Ivana \v Sumanovac,
Eckhard Birkner, Kathrin Klehs and all the other members of our group
for valuable discussions, support and review of the manuscript.

My sincere thanks to the European Union Framework Programme 7 (project
number 2115597) for the studentship on this project.
I also thank Erhard Ipp, G\"unter Z\"ochling, Vincent Galy, QueeLim
Ch'ng, J\"org Heber, Mark Eckert, Dirk Berndt, Joel Seligson and
Jean-Yves Tinevez for helpful collaboration.   

Furthermore I highly appreciate the input of Miroslav Grajcar, Edward
Rosten, Christophe Rhodes, Paul Khuong, Nikodemus Siivola, Levente
M\'esz\'aros and Lu\' is Oliveira. Occasionally, the expertise and
insight of them steered me into right direction or greatly simplified
problems I faced.

Finally, I wish to thank the authors and contributors to the following
software projects: Linux, GCC, Emacs, SBCL \citep{Rhodes2008}, Maxima,
Micromanager \citep{Edelstein2010}, DIPimage, Wireshark, Latex,
Inkscape, Gimp, ImageJ/Fiji \citep{Abramoff,Schindelin2012} and
Blender.  These free software projects and their communities are
invaluable to my work and greatly enhance my efficiency.

The work presented in this thesis is my own, unless I cite a reference
to acknowledge data or images to a different author. In the rest of
the thesis I use the word ``we'', even though I did the work myself.
