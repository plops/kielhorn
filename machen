p6 transition dipole moment
p7 10s of nm absorbtion band
p14 10^12 collisions per second
p19 cyclooctatetraene or O2 to minimize triplet triplet absorption, naphthalene, stilbene  low lying triplet states
p37 hydrogen vibrations important for infrared dyes in aqueous surroundings
pump in T_n to increase ISC rate
[46] coons 1942
 [55 1972Soep] triplet yield from fluorescin 0.03 up to 0.76 with eosin (4 bromine substituents)
p43 few chromophores with sufficient quantum yield that absorb above 620nm, fewer are available in reactive form, that can be coupled to other molecules
hydrogen vibrations have the highest energies for organic compounds
they are most likely to contribute to internal conversion between s1 and s0

elastic scatter rayleigh
inelastic raman
(both 1/lambda^4)
p78 dsred
p86 spontaneous emission
increased reaction capability os molecules in excited states
p87 15..30nm stokes shift
p89 trolox 1mM reduces blinking and bleaching of Cy5
even higher Tn
Roxs
reducing and oxidizing system

p100 fcs correlation
