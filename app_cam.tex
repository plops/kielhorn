\chapter{Read noise characterization of cameras}
\label{sec:ccd-meas}
\begin{summary}
  We describe a method to measure the read noise of a camera and
  compare the performance of three EM-CCDs.
\end{summary}
\section{Introduction}
In order to characterize a camera we captured sequences of images that
contain a light pattern as in \figref{fig:calib-pic}. The pattern is
smooth and non-uniform.
\begin{figure}[!hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{calib-pic}
  \caption{Image of a defocused area on a fluorescent plane sample. A
    couple of such images ($>20$) are captured and variance in each
    pixel is plotted against the intensity to find the correspondence
    between reported ADU and detected photoelectrons.}
  \label{fig:calib-pic}
\end{figure}
The images were produced in a fluorescence microscope. The light
source is a DPSS laser with \unit[473]{nm} wavelength. It
illuminates a circular area of the sample. The sample is a fluorescent
plane. A FITC filter cube and a $10\times$ objective were used. The
sample was adjusted to be slightly out of focus in order to obtain a
smooth intensity gradient in the image.

The light source is stable and the relative standard deviation of the
illumination intensity is typically $<0.2\%$ for the calibration
time. 

A sequence (20) of such images can be used to determine the mapping
between analog-to-digital units (ADU)
\nomenclature{ADU}{analog-to-digital unit} and the number of detected
photoelectrons. This method is based on the known relation between the
mean number of Poisson distributed photons and its variance.

For the calibration a 2D histogram of the per pixel
variance image and the per pixel mean of the image stack is
plotted. Then the slope of the resulting point cloud is determined.

\section{Calibration of an Andor IXon3 camera}

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=16cm]{../app_cam/ixon_conv1}

  \caption{{\bf top:} Conventional read out of an Andor IXon3
    camera. {\bf bottom:} Read out with an EM-gain setting of 300 on
    the same camera with identical sample. {\bf left:} 2D histogram of
    per pixel variances against binned intensities. {\bf middle:}
    variance of 20 dark images. {\bf right:} mean of 20 dark images.}
  \label{fig:ixon}
\end{figure}
  
In the top left diagram of \figref{fig:ixon} contains such a 2D
histogram. It was obtained for conventional readout at \unit[3]{MHz}
in our Andor IXon3 camera (head: DU-897D-CS0-\#BV). The variances are
collected in 64 intensity bins and their averages are plotted as red
crosses. The blue line is the result of a linear fit to the first
$60\%$ of the red crosses. Its slope gives the real gain of the camera
that can be used to convert ADU into photoelectrons (here
\unit[1.32]{$e/$ADU}).

The following figures show corresponding measurements using the EM
readout mode with varying EM gain. It is followed by one last
measurement with conventional readout to verify, that the fluorophores
didn't bleach too much during the experiment.

The camera was cooled to \unit[$-75$]{$\,^{\circ}{\rm C}$}. In order
to prevent overexposure of the sensor an image with a short
\unit[10]{ms} integration time was aquired and the integration time
for the experiment was set such that a maximum of \unit[10000]{ADU}
would occur. An internal shutter in the camera was closed to obtain
the dark images. The process was automated using an Andor Solis Basic
program which is listed below.

The square root of the mean of the variance of the dark images was
converted into a read noise in electrons per pixel using the real
gain.

The table in \figref{fig:ixon-table} summarizes the calibration
results.  The read noise in conventional mode is approximately 8
electrons per pixel rms. The column \textsf{mean'} contains the
average number of photoelectrons per pixel in the illuminated image
normalized by the integration time. The rows \textsf{conv1} and
\textsf{conv2} with conventional read out (without EM-gain) contain
approximately the same number. This proves that no significant
bleaching occurred during the experiment.

The EM gain process introduces multiplicative noise in the signal that
has the same effect on the photoelectron statistics as lowering the
quantum efficiency of the sensor. Dividing values of the column
\textsf{ mean'} from EM readouts by the same value from the
conventional readout gives the \emph{excess noise
  factor}\todo{get this right: should be $\sqrt{2}$}. Its
value is smaller than one and describes the apparent reduction of the
quantum efficiency.


Due to a bug in the capturing process the images in the second row
(for EM-gain 40) was overexposed and the data shouldn't be used.  Also
the last experiment \textsf{conv2} with conventional read out reports
a larger gain of \unit[1.6]{e/ADU} than the first experiment
\textsf{conv1} with gain \unit[1.3]{e/ADU}. Later we learned that one
should allow several seconds of settling time, when changing the
EM-gain voltage. This might explain the difference in gains, even
though one would think that the conventional read out should be
decoupled.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{../app_cam/ixon3}
  \caption{Comparison of read noise for different EM-gain settings
    (first column) of the Andor IXon3. The value $\textsf{mean}'$
    estimates the number of photo electrons the detector would have
    seen with \unit[1]{s} integration time and is used to calculate
    the excess noise factor in the last column. The images for the red
    row (EM-gain 40) were overexposed and the data are not correct. In
    EM-mode the fastest read out speed was used \unit[10]{MHz} with
    vertical shift speed of \unit[1.7]{us}.}

\section{Comparison with other cameras}
In order to compare different EM-CCD cameras one must first convert
the EM-gain register setting into the real EM-gain as cameras are
often not calibrated to have a linear gain curve and the
multiplicative gain changes with temperature and live time of the
sensor.

\figref{fig:old-cams} shows some calibrations on older cameras (Andor
IXon2 (head: DU-897E-CS0-\#BV, sensor: E2V Tech CCD97 $512\times512$,
pixel pitch \unit[16]{$\mu$m}, cooled to $-70{}^\circ\textrm{C}$) and
Photometrics Cascade~II (sensor: e2v CCD97, $512\times512$, pixel
pitch \unit[16]{$\mu$m}, cooled to $-70{}^\circ\textrm{C}$) which have
been done using the DIPimage function \textsf{cal-readnoise}.  The
real gain of the Andor IXon2 is $0.67/0.062=10.8$ and it has
\unit[0.46]{e\ rms/px} readnoise. The real gain of the Cascade~II is
$1.6/0.14=11.4$ with \unit[1.13]{e\ rms/px} read noise. Approximately
the same real gain is obtained with the IXon3 at EM-gain 50:
$1.32/0.12=11.0$ with a read noise of \unit[0.49]{e\ rms/px}. So the
two andor cameras show the same performance.

    $\textsf{mean}=\unit[122.08]{e/px}$, therefor the excess noise factor
    is 0.48.}
