\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work we document the development of a spatio-angular
microscope. An important part was to build a working prototype. We did
this in several steps.


Originally we planned a fast system. That didn't work.
Because we had to run it really slow without triggers.

Now we have a system, that can potentially run fast for the image
acquisition.  But uploading images to the displays is quite slow and
limits the range of experiments that can be done. Especially its not
fun to work with and considerably hinders prototyping new illumination
schemes.
